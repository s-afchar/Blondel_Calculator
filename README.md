# Stair calculator
 ## Before starting
 
This is the first time I write Python code, so it might be garbage. Indeed, for the sake of this assignment and for cross-platform compatibility reasons, I've translated some Visual Basic code I wrote during the first lockdown. Therefore, it may not be the most optimal code.

I made this programm because I was tired of going to [Calculis · Escalier](https://calculis.net/escalier) for this basic task and wanted a local alternative.
